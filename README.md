# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam McCarthy

I’m a student on the **Higher Diploma in Computer Science** at [SETU Waterford](https://www.setu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-computer-science-2-years-online), developing a strong foundation in software engineering and programming principles.
I did my Undergraduate, BSc (Hons) Mathematical Physics, at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/https%3A//www.maynoothuniversity.ie/physics/mh201-mathematical-physics). I’m particularly interested in **clean code**, **data analysis**, and **AI technologies**.
